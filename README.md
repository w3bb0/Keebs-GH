This is a proposal of uniformity of all the group buys occurring in the mechanical keyboard scene on the internet.

## Why?

The idea came about when I figured out the number of interesting group buys I wanted to join but missed out on because they were hidden in numerous threads. So, the idea is to find a solution __TOGETHER__ to have a uniform and easy way to aggregate all the current group buys occurring. Here is a proposal. If we could reach a standard format, then we can build an aggregator for all the GB and make it easier for everyone to monitor and join group buys.

__NOTE__: this project is COMPLETELY PROFITLESS and will stay this way.

## communities

Right now, the communities considered for aggregation are as follows
- Geek Hack
- Reddit
- Desk Authority
- Keeb Talk

Any others?

## Constraints

All the communities listed above are not using a standard forum framework, post formatâ€™s and so on. Also, people running Group Buys may not want to post to another platform. We are not planning to make an alternate platform to accomplish our goal. 

## Proposal

### Standard Post Format

Using a standard post format gives us a good chance of making this possible. For example https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/ has a specific format for all the posts and for the group buys it's the same as https://geekhack.org/ .
The current format is as follows -
[GB] Text ....`
The issue with this approach is we cannot figure out crucial information regarding things like the region of the GB and end date. The proposal would be:
```
[GB] [REGION] [END-DATE] {TITLE} : {COMMENT}
```
#### Title

This describes the title of the group buy, which added to the region and date give us enough information to store it in the system.

#### Comment

I know some titles change during the group buy and it's normal, that's why this section has been added and could change through the progression of the group buy.

#### Region

This describe the region of the GB:
- US *United-States*
- EU *Europe*
- AS *Asia*
- WW *WorldWide*

#### End Date

This is the end date of the group buy. The date format is as follows: MM/DD/YYYY

## Questions

- Should the status of the group buy be added as a standard header format?
- Is it interesting to extend it to Interest Check?
